# Rendering service

This service renders preview images of STL files with a sample program based on Github user fogleman's `fauxgl` project.

Run setup.sh to prepare the environment, clone the forked `fauxgl` project, and build the `model-preview` binary. Once
built, usage information is available by running `fauxgl/model-preview` with no arguments.
